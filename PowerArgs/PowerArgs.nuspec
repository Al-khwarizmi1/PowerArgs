    <description>$description$ - PowerArgs converts command line arguments into .NET objects that are easy to program against.  It also provides a ton of additional, optional capabilities that you can try such as argument validation, auto generated usage documentation, tab completion, Entity Framework querying, secure string arguments, and plenty of hooks for extensibility.</description>

    <releaseNotes>Did a full public surface API pass so ensure all public APIs are documented.  I marked some previously public items as internal where appropriate.  That should not happen again.  There were also a few bug fixes, the most interesting was that enum values were being treated as case sensitive by default which should not have been the case.  </releaseNotes>
