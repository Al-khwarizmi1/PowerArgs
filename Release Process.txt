Steps to release PowerArgs to Nuget

1  - Update PowerArgs.nuspec.
       - IF PREVIEW, hardcode a version with the -preview suffix. ELSE, use $version$.
 	   - Update the release notes
2  - IF NOT PREVIEW, update AssemblyInfo.cs and increment the version appropriately based on the changes.
3  - IF SURFACE AREA CHANGED - Update readme.md
        - Update the version in the documentation link
4  - Build and run all tests
5  - IF SURFACE AREA CHANGED - Run DoxygenPublisher PublishDoxygenDocs (Skipped last time)
6  - IF NOT PREVIEW, configure the project to be fully signed using the private key. Sign PowerArgs, PowerArgsTests, and PowerArgs.HttpExternalPipelineProvider.
        - Swap out the internalsVisibleTo attribute in AssemblyInfo.cs so that the build works.
7  - Build
8  - Run nuget pack -sym PowerArgs.csproj -Prop Platform=AnyCPU
9  - Run nuget push PowerArgs.<version>.nupkg (symbols failed last time.  Need to investigate.)
10 - IF NOT PREVIEW, revert the changes to the repository that fully signs the DLL.  
11 - IF NOT PREVIEW, delete the private key from the local dev environment and unsign all assemblies
12  - Commit pending changes and push to github/dev.
